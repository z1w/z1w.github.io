I am a final-year CS PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by [Somesh Jha](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jha/). In the past, I was advised by [Ben Liblit](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~liblit/). I am affliated with the fantasitic [madPL](https://madpl.cs.wisc.edu/) group. I was also mentored by [Thomas Reps](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~reps/), [Aws Albarghouthi](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~aws/) and [Yudong Chen](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yudongchen/). 

My research lies at the intersection of programming languages and deep learning. It stems from formalizing the computational phonomena in deep learning (We CS folks call formalizing *abstracting*; physicists would call it *modeling*), with an emphasis on analyzing the variational properties of neural networks. My research style is greatly influenced by Immanuel Kant and the classical GÃ¶ttingen school of mathematicians. Currently, I am very interested in [nonlinear algebra](https://bookstore.ams.org/gsm-211/).

I studied mathematics and philosophy at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign as an undergraduate. I also completed a master degree in computer science at the Courant Institute, New York University, before moving to Madison. At New York University, my research advisor was [Richard Cole](https://cs.nyu.edu/~cole/).

The best way to reach me is my email: "MyInitials (two letters) at cs.wisc.edu" (for example, <pl@cs.wisc.edu>).

Miscellaneous
=======
My recent favorite album is [RENAISSANCE](https://music.beyonce.com/). Great ideas will come back again and again ðŸ«¡.

My MOST favorite movie is [Life of Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Pi_(film)). Life is full of metaphors, and the prototypes underneath the metaphors are abstraction of the world.
